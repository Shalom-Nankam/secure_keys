We will be using the dartsv library for two main purposes:
- generate wallet addresses when trying to recieve tokens
- build the transactions to be signed by the strongbox 

To generate wallet addresses:
- We export our public key from the strongbox as byte array
- we use to dartsv lib to construct an SVPublic key from the byte array using SVPublicKey.fromDER()
- we convert the SVPublicKey to the address using the toAddress() method of SVPublicKey.

To sign transactions:
- First we build the transactions using utxos and other necessary inputs using dartsv
- we pass the built transaction to the strongbox to sign
